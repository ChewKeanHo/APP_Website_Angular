Static website generation (SSG) is a known and easy way to perform
immediate content publications and facilitating a web services.
Angular is often the corporate selection for web application usage.
However, when it comes to SSG, Angular is often perceived as
overpowered and complicated. While this is true, Angular 17 with
server-side rendering (SSR) capability can be configured to deliver
SSG output.

Therefore, Holloway's Angular Static Website Builder is established

git template repository. That way, anyone can utilize Angular for
quick SSG deployment.
